# randomise
Implementation in C++ of Randomise algorithm.

The plugin is made up of two parts:

1. A standalone randomise function that can be compiled and used anywhere.
2. A BrainVoyager plugin that wraps up the above function to integrate it into BrainVoyaer.

The plugin can be easily compiled on both Linux (using Qtcreator) and Windows (Using Visual Studio Community). For Mac users: download a customized version of clang that can compile openMP.

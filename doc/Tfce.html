</div>
<p><strong>Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE)</strong> is a method for finding &quot;clusters&quot; in the data without having to define clusters in a binary way (e.g. with a cluster threshold). The TFCE approach aims to enhance areas of signal that exhibit some spatial contiguity. The image is passed through an algorithm which enhances the intensity within cluster-like regions more than background (noise) regions. The output image is therefore not <em>intrinsically</em> thresholded/clustered.</p>

<p>The TFCE algorithm is illustrated in the figure above. The solid curve shows a 1D profile through and example statistic image (e.g. an unthresholded t statistic image). Each voxel's TFCE score is given by the sum of the scores of all &quot;supporting sections&quot; underneath it; as the height <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> is incrementally raised from zero up to the height (signal intensity) <span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> of a given point <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>, the image is thresholded at <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>, and the single contiguous cluster containing <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> is used to define the score for that height <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>. This score is simply the height <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> (raised to some power <span class="math inline"><em>H</em></span>) multiplied by the cluster extent <span class="math inline"><em>e</em></span> (raised to some power <span class="math inline"><em>E</em></span>). Precisely, the TFCE output at voxel <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> is</p>

</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub>0</sub></span> will typically be zero, and <span class="math inline"><em>E</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>H</em></span>, 0.5 and 2 respectively. In practice this integral is estimated as a sum, using finite <span class="math inline"><em>d</em><em>h</em></span>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this kind of statistics can only be used with a permutation framework. Indeed, without a permutation framework, there's no way to obtaine p-values, either uncorrected or corrected, from a cluster-enhanced output image, since there's no standard distribution to refer to.</p>
